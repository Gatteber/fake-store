# F.A.K.E - A fake store to live out your dreams.

A simple store built to hone react skills.

Technologies used:
React, Typescript, Tailwindcss

Reflection:
Once again, I've finished this project. To be honest, the hardest thing to fight was motivation to get the project itself done. I don't think I particularly struggled with one specific area of the project, but for some reason, I couldn't find the motivation to get work consistently done. I think typescript was an interesting choice to start picking up - I definitely need to spend more time actually diving into how to use it, as I often fell back onto the "any" type too often. I think for my next project as well, i'd like to get eslint + prettier working, as somehow when i started using react they didn't work as I expected them to. I think I may build another project of my own trying to use all of the technologies learned so far along with testing in order to get a better understanding of everything. I also didn't end up designing for mobile, but it's because i want to get a clear head and practice some of the skills i've learned from this project to apply to another.

Possible known bugs:
1.) If you click add to cart before the api call finishes, the add to cart is very buggy. I didn't know how to fix that, but i'm sure if i sat down i could get it.
2.) putting two similar items in a list makes them both delete. It's probably due to my id and render method for the map() and filter() calls.
